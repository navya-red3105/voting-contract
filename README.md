# voting-contract
A simple voting smart contract 
This repository contains a simple voting smart contract written in Solidity.
I built this project while learning smart contracts and blockchain development.

# What this contract does
- A chairperson creates a ballot with a fixed number of proposals
- Voters can be registered by the chairperson
- Registered voters can vote for one proposal
- The contract keeps track of votes and returns the winning proposal

# Why I built this
I wanted to understand how real-world logic like voting can be implemented
using smart contracts. This project helped me learn how data is stored
and updated on the blockchain.

# Concepts used
- Structs and mappings
- Arrays
- Constructors
- require statements
- View functions

## Tools
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Remix IDE
